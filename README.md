🩺 Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

📌 Overview

This project predicts whether a patient is likely to have diabetes based on medical diagnostic features such as glucose level, BMI, age, and other health indicators.
The goal is to demonstrate the application of Machine Learning in healthcare for early risk detection.
